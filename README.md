# SphereScript (for SphereServer-X) Visual Studio Code Extension

* Work in progress. At the moment the syntax highlighting is pretty good but the extension doesn't feel complete yet, so it's not available in the VSCode store.
* Would like to contribute? See CONTRIBUTING.md and check GitHub issues for feature requests and issues!
